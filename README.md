This application has been highly inspired by @irefuse and is a full refactored version of the orginal repo.  

Based on Electron, Webpack, Vue, Express, Axios, Element-UI and Node this does not have any extra
dependencies. With this we can createa a cross platform application that works on mac, linux and Windows
and provides a nice GUI.

So there you have it. How can you use it?  

### on PS4

2.) Start flatZ Remote Package Installer  

### on PC  
1.) Start PS4 Package Sender V2   
2.) Switch to Config and select your Networkinterface (IP Adress)  
    2.1) Choose a Server Port if necessary and apply or restart the server  
3.) Choose your base path where your files are settled  
4.) Switch to Server and add your files to the queue (Processing Center)

## Troubleshooting  
Your PS4 and PC have to be on the same Network.  
If you have connection issues, check your Router or Firewall.  
If you get timeout, RPI is not running on your PS4 or PS4 IP Adress is wrong or timeout to low.   
If you get Playstation not available error, check RPI on PS4 and restart it.  
If you get the White Screen of Dead, use the unpacked version.  
If you think there is an issue, please report it.
