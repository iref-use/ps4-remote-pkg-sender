    Hello Ladies and Gentlemen! <br>
    <br>
    It has been a long journey so far, and you have done well! <br>
    With 53k Downloads as of August 2023, that's quite impressive <br>
    <small style="font-size: 90%">(67k Downloads as of February 2024) </small><br>
    <small style="font-size: 90%">(79k Downloads as of May 2024) </small><br>
    Thank you for using the Application. Any Support is appreciated and don't forget to check out my channels. <br>
    <br>
    I will talk about a couple big changes that will come soon or later, depending on your support. <br>
    This particular update (v2.9.1) has been delayed almost over one year (last update August 2022). <br>
    I've put a <el-tag size="mini" type="danger" class="cursor-pointer" @click="$root.open('https://ko-fi.com/gkiokan/goal?g=0')" target="_blank">Ko-Fi Goal</el-tag> out there, so anyone who wants to donate are welcome! <br>
    The faster the Goal hits, the more time I can spend on the updates - choice is yours :) <br>
    <br>
    Note: This View will became the User Profile Center after the update<br>

    <h2 style="font-size: 20px"> What is coming up? </h2>
    <b>0) PS5 Support </b> [Done]<br>
    With 2.10.0+ we are the first application that supports PKG Install though application requests. <br>
    First prototyping works fine, but still we might need more feedback on this to mark it stable. <br>
    Thanks to etaHEN (@LM) and all the devs who was working on this - huge step forward. <br>
    
    <div class="space-50" />

    <b>1) Application Serial Numbers </b> [Done] <br>
    Every Application in version 2.9.0+ will have it's own Serial number now. <br>
    This will be required for later encryption and decryption of messages and data for the features. <br>
    
    <div class="space-50" />

    <b>2) RPSV2 API Service </b> [prepared] <br>
    With the RPSV2 API Service we will be able to handle dynamic configurations in the future. <br>
    I've created a first configuration api and will benchmark in version 2.9.1 on how good this goes for <br>
    all the users. This brings us many benefits like expanding Themes or Languages without the need <br>
    of new Release Builds, connecting the Chrome Extension or Mobile app (later on, once it's build and deployed). <br>
    <br>
    This includes also a User Management, to connect all App users together for different purposes. <br>
    Means you can register and login into your Account and Manage a bunch of stuff out of the App. <br>
    
    <div class="space-50" />

    <b>3) Translation </b> [WIP] <br>
    So long requested and still not here. The reason beeing I wasn't happy about a native implementation <br>
    of the translation files. But based on the RPSV2 API Service this will be done quite soon. <br>

    <div class="space-50" />

    <b>4) Files from Remote Hosts </b> [planed] <br>
    This will be really huge. Users can share their PKG files between Users. <br>
    This feature will be possible because of Point 1 and 2. The RPSV2 API Service will handle all the <br>
    configuration and communication where as the Serial numbers will act as a handshake encryption <br>
    between the Users. On Top of all there will be a secure tunnel. Thats at least what is planed. <br>
    <br>
    Just imagine you create your own PKG Host and share that as a Service to your friends! <br>
    They wouldn't need to download and install files, they could do it directly over the Service. <br>

    <div class="space-50" />

    <b>5) Integrated FTP Client </b> <br>
    As the name says, the Integrated FTP Client will allow you to navigate directly to your PS4 <br>
    and allow you to move files arround. This may be interesting for the IPI Installation method <br>
    or as an alternative to manage files from/to/on the PS4. <br>
    
    <div class="space-50" />

    <b>6) GoldHEN Cheats Manager </b> <br>
    Not sure who needs that, but it should be pretty simple to build that based on Point 4 and extend <br>
    the functionality by syncing up with the GoldHEN Cheats Repository on GitHub. Cute enough as a Bonus. <br>

          Thank you for using my <b>Remote Package Sender v2</b>! <br>
          <br>
          Hope you like it so far what I've build and I would really appreciate any feedback and support. <br>
          <br>
          If you want to Support me and my development, you can do this on Ko-Fi. <br>
          That high quality application development is done in my free time and takes much effort. <br>
          There are so many nice features that are on my todo (black)-list that are not done yet. <br>
          I'd like to invest more time into this Tool and provide you one of the best Tools ever. <br>
