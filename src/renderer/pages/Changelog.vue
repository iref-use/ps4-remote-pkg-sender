        <h4>Welcome PS5 Support</h4>
        <p>
          With the new Features from etaHEN we are finally able to be the first application <br>
          that does support Installing PKG files on your Konsole. This is a huge step forward.<br>   
          To use that feature, you have to select <b>Config > Playstation App > etaHEN</b>. <br>
          <br>       
          Due the ongoing Platform rewrite for PKG-zone there was a bug in the HB-Store view, it's fixed now. <br>
          The PKG-Zone will be updated soon anyway, so there is a bigger rework planed for the Feature here. <br>
          Based on that I've added proper HB-Store PS5 PKG Support for now, so you can download it at least correctly.<br>
          There are also other improvements here and there and a bunch of refactoring. <br>
