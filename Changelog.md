# PS4 Remote PKG Sender v2  - Changelog

### v2.10.4
#### macOS 14.4+ fixes
        The latest mac OS Version 14.4+ has a couple dependency changes that break the application.  
        Fixed the dependencies and deprecations.

### v2.10.3
#### Welcome PS5 Support        
        With the new Features from etaHEN we are finally able to be the first application
        that does support Installing PKG files on your Konsole. This is a huge step forward.
        To use that feature, you have to select Config > Playstation App > etaHEN.

        Due the ongoing Platform rewrite for PKG-zone there was a bug in the HB-Store view, it's fixed now.
        The PKG-Zone will be updated soon anyway, so there is a bigger rework planed for the Feature here.
        Based on that I've added proper HB-Store PS5 PKG Support for now, so you can download it at least correctly.
        There are also other improvements here and there and a bunch of refactoring.
